### Steps for Data Analysis and Visualization

1. **Data Extraction (Web Scraping):**
   - Identified the data source for Tesla and Gameplay information (e.g., websites providing financial or gaming data).
   - Used a web scraping library (like `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium`) to extract the relevant data, such as stock prices for Tesla and user engagement statistics for Gameplay.
   - Collected data for multiple dates or time intervals to analyze trends.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant information from the raw data.
   - Handled missing values by filling them with appropriate values (mean, median, or forward/backward fill) or dropping rows/columns if necessary.
   - Converted data types (e.g., dates to `datetime` format, prices to floats) to ensure consistency in analysis.

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Created separate DataFrames for Tesla and Gameplay data.
   - Merged or aligned the data based on common attributes, such as dates, if needed for comparative analysis.
   - Sorted the data in chronological order to prepare it for time series analysis.

4. **Data Visualization (Line Chart):**
   - Plotted the time-series data of Tesla’s stock price on a line chart, showing how the prices changed over time.
   - Plotted Gameplay’s user engagement data over the same or a different timeline to identify trends or patterns.
   - Applied labels, titles, and legends to the charts for clarity, making sure the x-axis represented time and the y-axis represented the respective metrics (stock prices for Tesla, engagement rates for Gameplay).

6. **Interpretation of Results:**
   - Analyzed the patterns from the line charts to draw conclusions about the trends.
   - For Tesla, this could involve insights into periods of price volatility, price surges, or declines.
   - For Gameplay, observations could include spikes in user activity, periods of decline, or steady growth patterns.
